## üõ°Ô∏è **Core Safety Principles**

### **Safety-First Philosophy**
```
User Safety > Product Features > Business Metrics > Technical Innovation
```

**Fundamental Commitments:**
- **Do No Harm**: Never provide advice that could worsen relationships or endanger users
- **Know Our Limits**: Clearly acknowledge when situations require human professionals
- **Escalate When Needed**: Immediate human intervention for crisis situations
- **Transparent Operations**: Users always know they're interacting with AI
- **Privacy by Design**: Protect user data as if it were our own family's

---

## üö® **Crisis Detection System**

### **Multi-Tier Crisis Classification**
```typescript
interface CrisisLevels {
  emergency: {
    indicators: ["Physical violence", "Suicide risk", "Child safety"];
    keywords: ["hit me", "kill myself", "hurts my child"];
    response: "Immediate human escalation + emergency resources";
    timeline: "<5 minutes";
  };
  
  high: {
    indicators: ["Psychological abuse", "Mental health crisis"];
    keywords: ["controls everything", "severe depression"];
    response: "Human review within 2 hours + crisis resources";
    timeline: "<2 hours";
  };
  
  medium: {
    indicators: ["Relationship distress", "Emotional overwhelm"];
    keywords: ["can't take anymore", "breaking point"];
    response: "Enhanced monitoring + professional resources";
    timeline: "<24 hours";
  };
}
```

### **Crisis Detection Algorithm**
```typescript
async function detectCrisis(text: string, emotion: EmotionData): Promise<CrisisResult> {
  // Step 1: Keyword pattern matching
  const keywordMatches = scanForCrisisKeywords(text);
  
  // Step 2: Emotional intensity analysis
  const emotionalCrisis = assessEmotionalCrisis(emotion);
  
  // Step 3: Context analysis (conversation history)
  const contextualRisk = analyzeConversationContext(text);
  
  // Step 4: Combined risk scoring
  const riskScore = calculateRiskScore(keywordMatches, emotionalCrisis, contextualRisk);
  
  if (riskScore >= 0.9) return { level: "emergency", immediate: true };
  if (riskScore >= 0.7) return { level: "high", urgent: true };
  if (riskScore >= 0.4) return { level: "medium", monitor: true };
  
  return { level: "none", safe: true };
}
```

### **Crisis Response Protocol**
```typescript
interface CrisisResponse {
  immediate: {
    stopConversation: "Halt all AI coaching immediately";
    displayWarning: "Clear safety warning with calm messaging";
    provideResources: "National hotlines and local emergency services";
    connectHuman: "Live connection to crisis counselor within 5 minutes";
  };
  
  resources: {
    domesticViolence: "1-800-799-7233 (National Domestic Violence Hotline)";
    suicidePrevention: "988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline)";
    childAbuse: "1-800-422-4453 (Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline)";
    emergency: "911 for immediate physical danger";
  };
  
  humanEscalation: {
    availability: "24/7 licensed crisis counselors on standby";
    response: "Maximum 5-minute connection time for emergencies";
    protocol: "Warm handoff with context (anonymized)";
    followUp: "48-hour safety check for all emergency escalations";
  };
}
```

## üîí **Privacy Protection Framework**

### **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**
```typescript
interface PrivacyDesign {
  dataMinimization: {
    collect: "Only essential coaching context and emotion patterns";
    avoid: "No names, locations, phone numbers, or identifying details";
    anonymous: "Complete anonymous usage without any data collection";
    retention: "User-controlled deletion, maximum 30-day retention";
  };
  
  encryption: {
    clientSide: "AES-256 encryption before any transmission";
    transmission: "TLS 1.3 with certificate pinning";
    storage: "Encrypted at rest with user-specific keys";
    voiceData: "Processed in memory only, never stored";
  };
  
  compliance: {
    gdpr: "Full GDPR compliance with data subject rights";
    ccpa: "California Consumer Privacy Act compliance";
    hipaa: "HIPAA-level security standards (voluntary)";
    soc2: "SOC 2 Type II certification for data handling";
  };
}
```

### **Anonymous Usage Model**
```typescript
interface AnonymousAccess {
  capabilities: {
    voiceCoaching: "Full voice coaching without registration";
    emotionDetection: "Real-time emotion analysis and feedback";
    crisisDetection: "Complete crisis detection and human escalation";
    basicSkills: "Access to all core communication skills";
  };
  
  limitations: {
    noProgress: "Cannot track improvement over time";
    noPersonalization: "Cannot learn user preferences";
    noHistory: "Cannot reference previous conversations";
    sessionBased: "All data deleted when session ends";
  };
  
  upgradeOptions: {
    optional: "Account creation entirely optional";
    dataPortability: "Export session data before account creation";
    continuity: "Seamless transition from anonymous to registered";
    retroactive: "No retroactive data collection from anonymous sessions";
  };
}
```
